# GitHub Upload Instructions for Soltree

Since git operations are restricted in this environment, here are the steps to upload your Soltree project to GitHub:

## Method 1: Using the Archive Feature (Recommended)

1. **Create Archive**: Click the "Archive Source Code" button in your Soltree app
2. **Check Archive**: The zip file will be saved in the `rar/` folder in your project
3. **Download from Replit**: Use the Files panel menu (⋯) to download the entire project as zip
4. **Extract and Upload to GitHub**:
   - Extract the downloaded zip on your computer
   - Go to https://github.com/StaplezStudio/Soltree
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all project files (exclude `node_modules`, `.replit`, `replit.nix`)
   - Commit with message: "Initial commit: Soltree - Solana Merkle Tree Creator"

## Method 2: Manual Download from Replit

1. **Download Project**:
   - In Replit, click Files panel menu (⋯)
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract files on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/StaplezStudio/Soltree
   - Upload all extracted files (exclude `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `node_modules`)

## Method 3: Using Git Locally (if available)

```bash
# Clone your GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/StaplezStudio/Soltree.git
cd Soltree

# Copy your downloaded/extracted files here
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Soltree - Solana Merkle Tree Creator"
git push origin main
```

**If you see "fetch first" error:**
```bash
git push origin main --force
```
(This overwrites GitHub's initial README with your complete project)
